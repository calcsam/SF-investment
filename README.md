Like most other startup-ers around the Bay, I’ve heard a constant drumbeat 
of “the startup scene is moving to San Francisco.”

But I never saw any good data, so I created these maps: cartograms scaling 
cities based on how much financing local startups received.

I used the files here for three things:
- pulling SEC data
- creating a Bay Area map by ZIP code (none existed, except for one made by
the city of SF which omitted San Jose)
- rendering the maps by ZIP code.

The intermediate step of data analysis and grouping by ZIP code was done in 
O Ye TimeTested tool, Microsoft Excel.

The final project is online at fundmap.vc.
